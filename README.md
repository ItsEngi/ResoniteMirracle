# <p align="center"> ðŸªžâœ¨ Mirracle, A feature-rich mirror [Facet](https://wiki.resonite.com/Facets) for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/)

:information_source: **Mirracle is a feature-rich mirror facet that focuses on convenience**, situational flexibility, and delighting its users. It takes a new approach to mirrors - using a 2D camera that follows the star of the show: you! Its stand-out feature is decoupled mode, where the camera can be "decoupled" from the dash and freely moved around. When combined with FOV, Angle, and Height options this allows for users to conveniently inspect their avatar from any angle.
